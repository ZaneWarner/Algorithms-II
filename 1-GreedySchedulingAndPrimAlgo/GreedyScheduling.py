#This is second coding assignment for Algorithms II from Stanford Lagunita
#The task is to implement a greedy algorithm for scheduling tasks to minimize a weighted sum of completion times
#We sort tasks by weight-length, breaking ties by scheduling higher-weight tasks first, then arbitrarily
#It is not guaranteed to compute an optimal solution
